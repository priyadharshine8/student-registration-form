Student Registration Form with Advanced Validation

This project implements a fully functional Student Registration Form designed with a user-friendly interface and multiple validation rules. The form includes fields for Name, Email, Password, Gender, Hobbies, and Course Selection. Each field is validated to ensure accurate and complete input before submission:

Name: Cannot be left empty.
Email: Must follow a valid email format.
Password: Must meet a minimum length requirement.
Gender: Requires the user to select an option (Male, Female, Other).
Hobbies: At least one hobby must be chosen from the list.
Course Selection: Users must select a course from the dropdown list.

Additional features include a Submit button (enabled only after validations are satisfied) and a Reset button that clears all inputs for convenience. The form ensures a smooth and reliable data entry process while preventing incomplete or invalid submissions.
